- The **model**, or in other words our app's data. In Vue.js this is simply a JavaScript object containing variables and their initial values.

- An HTML template, the correct terminology for which is **view**. Here we chose what to display, add event listeners, and handle different usages for the model.

- **ViewModel** - a Vue instance that binds the model and view together, enabling them to communicate with each other.

- simple JavaScript object for all the options

- `{{double brackets}}` for templating

- `v-something` inline attributes for adding functionality directly in the HTML.
